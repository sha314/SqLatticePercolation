Percolation on a Square Lattice


Method to run the program:
1. using commands as described in cmd.args.txt file
2. using a "source form" file. You take the form file and fill it up.
    Then pass the name of the source file as command line argument.
    The program reads the file and run the program as described in the
    form. If no form is supplied as argument then the program creates
    "input.form.txt" file which contains all information which to be filled.
