## 1# mean cluster size
It is the ratio of the second and the first moment of n_s. That is, 
\sum_s s^2 n_s/sum_s s n_s 
excluding the largest or the spanning cluster.

\sum_s s^2 n(s) / \sum_s s n(s)

basically, (s_1^2+s_2^2+...+s_k^2)/(s_1+s_2+---+s_k) but you exclude the largest or the spanning cluster.
do it for each value of p.
